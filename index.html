<h1 style =  background-color:#f8f7f6>Disco Elysium VS. Baldurs Gate 3</h1>

<div class = "normal"> The two games are well known, supes succesful CRPGs. And I shall compare them. <a href= "https://discoelysium.com/">Disco Elysium</a> origininally came out in Octoer 2019 to PC and was developed by <a href = https://zaumstudio.com>ZA/UM</a>, a small independent company based in Europe. <br> The game is absolutely fantastic it's so cool and I'm saying that and I haven't even finished it. I''ll go onto a long long rant about how awesome it is later. <br> On the other hand we've got <a href = "https://baldursgate3.game">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, the third installment in the Baldur's Gate series created by Larian and released in August 2023. <br> No joke also such and awesome awesome game like seriously could rant abt these games for so long but I'll save that cuz i gotta use lists and stuff. </div>
